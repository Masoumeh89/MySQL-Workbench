INNER JOIN products ON sales.item_num = products.item_num
INNER JOIN customers ON sales.cust_id = customers.cust_id
GROUP BY products.item_num, products.description, customers.cust_name
LIMIT 0, 1000;

```
</pre>



- Identify the top 5 customers who made the highest total purchases, including details about the purchases.

<pre>
```

FROM purchases
INNER JOIN sales ON purchases.item_num = sales.item_num
INNER JOIN customers ON sales.cust_id = customers.cust_id
